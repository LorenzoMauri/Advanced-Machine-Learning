## Overview
* Task : predict the correct orientation of an image with respect to the coarse angles of 0, 90, 180,and 270 degrees.

> In this work we leverage the power of deep learning and adapt pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks to the image canonical orientation detection task.
In order to address this problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information, both present in indoor and outdoor images or photos. 
Similar to human perception, Convolutional Neural Networks can take into account semantic cues to predict the correct orientation of the coarse angles 0, 90, 180,and 270 degrees.

## Dataset

* To be generated by the students

> One of the twomain data sources considered is the large-scale benchmark dataset for scene recognition *SUN397*.  It contains 108754 images in 397 different categories with at least 100 images per category.
> The other main data source considered is the *MIT Indoor dataset* which con-tains  15620  images  in  67  different  categories  with  at  least  100  images  per category. 

## Requirements 


## Resources and how-to-run
In the `notebook` folder the following .ipynb files are provided : 

* `generator_executed_successfully` : this notebook contains the source code for the generation of the dataset used to train the model. More specifically : 
     *  it downloads the `INDOOR_CVPR_09` images from the [ufficial website](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/LabelMe/NewImages/)
     *  it rotates the `INDOOR_CVPR_09` images into four orientations and collocates them into their respective folders (0,90,180 and 270 degrees angles).
     * it backups all the data to Google Drive for future usage 

* `vgg16_executed_successfully` : this notebook implements the VGG-16 model and contains the related source code. In particular : 
     * it migrates and loads the (previous) generated dataset along with the `SUN397` dataset from Google Drive to the            Colab instance.
 
       Please note that, for a correct execution,  all the pathnames in the `Prepare Data` section must be modified since          they are linked to our specific use case.
       
     * it merges the two dataset to get a unique one. Then it builds, tunes and saves the model.
