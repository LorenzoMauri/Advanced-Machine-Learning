## Assignment 1

The assignment consists in the prediction of the price (same name as the target variable in the dataset) of a private room/entire apartment using a neural network.

The dataset includes all the information you need to learn more about hosts, geographic availability, and necessary metrics of Airbnb apartments in New York City in 2019.

The provided data comprises the training set that can be used for the training (and eventually for the validation) and the unlabelled test set.

In order to be evaluated, each student should submit a zip file named Nome_Cognome_Matricola_assignment1.zip containing all and only

- the source code;
- a brief PDF or WORD report (1 or 2 pages) with some motivations about the choices on the data processing, the number and dimension of the layers, the activation functions and the loss functions, and some comments about the results.
- (optional) a txt file named Nome_Cognome_Matricola_score1.txt, where each line corresponds to the prediction of the instances of the test set. The file should contain only this column and with no header. In the case of standardization/normalization of the target variable, scale back the predictions to the original representation.
Collaboration is allowed, but the final product must be individual.

After the deadline, the name of the students with the highest regression performance (in terms of lowest Root Mean Square Error ) evaluated on the submitted results will be announced. Only well-formatted submissions will be considered.
