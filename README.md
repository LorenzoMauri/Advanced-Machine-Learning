## Overview
* Task : predict the correct orientation of an image with respect to the coarse angles of 0, 90, 180,and 270 degrees.

> In this work we leverage the power of deep learning and adapt pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks to the image canonical orientation detection task.
In order to address this problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information, both present in indoor and outdoor images or photos. 
Similar to human perception, Convolutional Neural Networks can take into account semantic cues to predict the correct orientation of the coarse angles 0, 90, 180,and 270 degrees.

## Dataset

* To be generated by the students

In order to tackle this task we build a dataset made up of both indoor and outdoor scenes. To accomplish that, let's take into account the following data sources :  

* SUN397  : ottenuto dal sito ufficiale : https://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2010/SUN/ 
* INDOOR : ottenuto dal sito ufficiale  https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html  

Data PreProcessing : 
Images are rotated by coarse angles of 90,180 e 270 degrees and then resized (224x224 format) .
This is useful to reduce the size of the whole dataset. 

## Requirements 


## Resources and how-to-run


#### INDOOR
The following .tar files are generated  :

* rotatedImages.tar 

* rotatedImages.tar

#### SUN397
Sono presenti 10 partizioni ufficiali : consideriamo solo la prima (approx 13 GB da dividere per 4 classi) 
Vengono generati i file presenti in Drive nella corrispondente cartella SUN
nb. In questo caso viene effettuato il download del dataset e per comodità elaborato in locale per poi essere caricato sul Drive e quindi usato in Colab.

NO resizing 224x224



## Models 
First let's begin with building the models and apllying Transfer Learning on Imagenet dataset.

* Vgg16
* Mobilenet v2
