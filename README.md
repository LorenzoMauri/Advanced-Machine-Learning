## Overview
* Task : predict the correct orientation of an image with respect to the coarse angles of 0, 90, 180,and 270 degrees.

> In this work we leverage the power of deep learning and adapt pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks to the image canonical orientation detection task.
In order to address this problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information, both present in indoor and outdoor images or photos. 
Similar to human perception, Convolutional Neural Networks can take into account semantic cues to predict the correct orientation of the coarse angles 0, 90, 180,and 270 degrees.

## Dataset

* To be generated by the students

> One of the twomain data sources considered is the large-scale benchmark dataset for scene recognition *SUN397*.  It contains 108754 images in 397 different categories with at least 100 images per category.
> The other main data source considered is the *MIT Indoor dataset* which con-tains  15620  images  in  67  different  categories  with  at  least  100  images  per category.
